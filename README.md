# 🚀ProjectPortfolio-III-Spotify

### 🚁Project Overview - 
This project is to function as a m middle man source to connect to spotify as a sister, brother, cousing, etc. Depending on the state of your login in tokens, it will determine if you would need to login, or not login at all. Basic functionality would navigate you to a login screen, once logged in it will take you to a screen that will say "No Results". From there you will utilize the search bar to search an artist. The artist will be pulled from an API source housed by spotify itself.

### 🤖Prerequisites - 
Software requirements would be nodejs 1.0.0, a small package to house dependencies such as dotenv, express, mongoose, and nodemon.

### 🌵Getting Started -
To get this project up and running, inside the terminal of whatever IDE you're utilizing, running a command npm run dev. That will initiate the server to run the project.
